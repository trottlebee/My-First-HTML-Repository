                <h3>Career Strategy</h3>
                <p>I am trying to make a career transition to web design/development and software/mobile development.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a long time</li>
                    <li>Until very recently, the opportunity hasn't been there, timewise/money-wise</li>
                    <li>But now, I'm prepared to take the leap into online design/development</li>

                <p>Ideally, merging the design and branding skills with coding.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The career-change options seem limitless</li>
                    <li>I figure I can begin with enhancing the web development skills at first</li>
                    <li>Then add software/full-stack development as I go</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I was so glad to discover, earlier this year, that Covalence offers an immersive course that exposes
                        students to full-stack development</li>
                    <li>I'm confident the course will help me decipher my next-steps as I proceed with the career transition</li>
                    <li>Also, the City of Birmingham seems to be getting even more on-board with tech trends as it preps for
                        a brighter future

                    <li>I really appreciate each of them preparing us for issues in coding, the command line, and VS Code that
                        we will likely run into with older generations of files</li>

                    <li>When I was roughly 10/11 years old, I developed an interest in the programming languages, BASIC and COBOL.</li>
                    <li>I wanted to create a video game like Space Invaders or Frogger, but I couldn't grasp the language syntax.</li>
                    <li>I remember a time when there were no computers in homes, only commercial offices.</li>
                    <li>Smartphone technology was not available for many years. In my formative years, we used an avocado green
                        rotary dial phone.</li>
                    <li>The technological advances made are overwhelming--in a good way--when I think about it.</li>

                        by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. An urban reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's
                        novel, <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>, featuring an entirely African-American cast, the film was loosely
                        adapted from the 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. It follows the adventures of Dorothy, a
                        shy twenty-four-year-old Harlem schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban
                        fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles an alternative fantasy version of New York City. Befriended by
                        a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with
                        the mysterious Wiz, who they say is the only one powerful enough to send her home.
